I'm from a middle class family, currently pursuing Graduation at Andhra University in Computer Science dept.
Staying at budget friendly PG's helps in reducing the unnecesary expenses which is burden on my family.

I usually turn to books or mobile when in boredom. But good books are way too much price for me which i can't bare to purchase them.
So, in search of a solution i found the hardcopy mobile app which i got referal from one of my friends where they made renting possible.
Now i can read as many books as i can with minimal costs which i only have to pay for the days spent to read them.
Finally it great to be an user of this app and increase the count of books i've read in my shelf.

Thankyou
